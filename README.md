# PPM-Image-Editor
This C program takes PPM files as inputs and allows the user to do one of the three options:

1. Remove all the read from a image by setting all red bits in each pixel to 0

2. Turn the input image to black and white

3. Reformat the picture to a square by cutting down on either exceeding rows or columns
